# To access the contents of Confluence from your Python program, you can use the Confluence REST API. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to do that:

# Step 1: Set Up API Access
#     Create an API Token:
#                          If you are using Confluence Cloud, generate an API token from your Atlassian account under Account settings > Security > API token.
#     Get Your Confluence URL:
#                          Note your Confluence site URL (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net).
# Step 2: Install Required Libraries
#     You'll need the requests library to make HTTP requests. You can install it using pip: pip install requests
